This project is designed to help demonstrate to developers of ASP.NET web applications how different vulnerabilities in their code could lead to compromise of their application.

The project hopes to build something comparable to Webgoat but with ASP.NET as the target platform. Currently a companion blog is being grown to discuss the vulnerabilities that will be incorporated in to this application: http://eagle-site.blogspot.com/
